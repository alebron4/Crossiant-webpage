      <p>
        Croissants are a traditional French pastry, best enjoyed at breakfast
        time fresh and on their own, or accompanied by coffee. If you’ve ever
        eaten a croissant, you know how messy they can be! There are many ways
        to eat a plain croissant on its own to avoid getting crumbs all over
        yourself and butter on your fingers, or for a more complete meal you can
        even make them into a delicious breakfast sandwich!
